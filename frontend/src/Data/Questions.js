        question:
          "What are the differences between class components and functional components in React?",
        answer:
          "Class components are ES6 classes that extend from React.Component, and they are used to define a component using the class syntax. Functional components are JavaScript functions that take props as arguments and return React elements. One key difference is that class components can hold state (using `this.state` and `setState`), whereas functional components cannot until the introduction of React Hooks.",

        id: 2,
        question: "How does React handle state management?",
        answer:
          "React uses state to manage data that can change over time within a component. State is typically initialized in a constructor for class components or using the `useState` hook for functional components. To update state, you use the `setState` method in class components or the updater function returned by `useState` in functional components.",

        question:
          "Explain the concept of virtual DOM in React and its significance.",
        answer:
          "The virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM. React uses it to perform efficient updates to the UI. When state or props change, React creates a new virtual DOM tree, compares it with the previous one, and calculates the minimal set of DOM mutations needed to update the actual DOM. This approach improves performance by minimizing unnecessary re-renders and DOM manipulations.",

        answer:
          "In Node.js, asynchronous operations are handled using callbacks, promises, or async/await syntax. Callbacks are the traditional way to handle asynchronous code, where a function is passed as an argument to another function to be executed later. Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous code by allowing you to chain asynchronous operations and handle errors more effectively. Async/await is a more modern approach that allows you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous style using async functions and the await keyword.",

        answer:
          "Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. Each object in JavaScript has a prototype chain, which is a linked list of prototypes. When you access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first looks for it on the object itself. If it doesn't find it, it looks at the object's prototype, and so on, until it reaches the end of the prototype chain.",

        answer:
          "Event delegation in JavaScript is a technique where you attach an event listener to a parent element, rather than to individual child elements. When an event occurs, it bubbles up from the child elements to the parent element, allowing you to handle events on multiple elements with a single event listener. Event delegation is useful for improving performance and simplifying event handling, especially for dynamically generated content.",

        question: "Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript.",
        answer:
          "Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, regardless of where they are declared in the code. This means that you can use a variable or function before it is declared, although it's best practice to declare variables and functions before using them to avoid confusion.",

        answer:
          "In JavaScript, the `this` keyword refers to the context in which a function is called. The value of `this` is determined dynamically based on how a function is invoked, rather than where it is defined. The value of `this` can vary depending on whether a function is called as a method of an object, using the `new` keyword, with `call` or `apply`, or in the global scope.",

It involves breaking down large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them using foreign keys. Denormalization, on the other hand, is the process of intentionally introducing redundancy into a database schema to improve query performance by reducing the need for joins and simplifying data retrieval. It trades off storage space for query performance and is often used in read-heavy applications.",
